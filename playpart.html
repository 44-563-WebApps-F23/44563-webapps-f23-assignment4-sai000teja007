    <h1>Sai Teja Thatikonda Acts in a play</h1>
    <h3>An Enemy of the People. Author-<i>Henrik Ibsen</i></h3>
    <p>Petra: No, not yet, but you shall have it in good time.</p>

        (DR. STOCKMANN comes in from his room with an open letter in his hand.)
        
       <p> Dr. Stockmann: (waving the letter). Well, now the town will have
        something new to talk about, I can tell you!</p>
        
      
        
       <p> Mrs. Stockmann: What is this?</p>
        
       <p> Dr. Stockmann: A great discovery, Katherine.</p>
        
        <p>Hovstad: Really?</p>
    
        
       <p> Dr. Stockmann: A discovery of mine. (Walks up and down.) Just let them
        come saying, as usual, that it is all fancy and a crazy man's
        imagination! But they will be careful what they say this time, I can
        tell you!</p>
        
        <p>Petra: But, father, tell us what it is.
